## Project Description: ##
The core concept of this project is to develop a way to examine levels and aspects of poverty as experienced by various communities across the United States. While two communities may experience similar levels of poverty, the attributes, or what poverty looks like in each community, may be very different. This project offers a framework for comparing and contrasting the various 'faces' of poverty by focussing on a select catalog of environmental, social, and economic factors that we hope will allow users to go beyond the standard and often used dichotomies of urban vs rural, white vs non-white communities, coastal vs interior geographies, etc.

### Nice to Have Features:

## [License](https://github.com/mheinle1/cas502_project/blob/main/LICENSE)
For our team, thoughts about licensing, trademark, and copyright are new issues. We both gravitated toward license structures that committed project code to the public domain and allowed for broadest application and re-use while ensuring that the code could not be claimed or its use and distribution hindered. Our team discussed both CC0 and the Unlicense. After performing a bit of web research, the consensus among the sources we interrogated was that CC0 was more robust and had a more well established legal history at this time. We also preferred the additional liability protection that, at least in appearance, is offered by CC0.
