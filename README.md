Project Title: Facets of Poverty in the United States

Description: This project is an exploritory inquery into the various 
faces and facets of poverty in the United States.

Challenges: A technical challenge we foresee is correlating all the data with geographic coordinates. While census 
and ACS (American Community Surveys) data employ the census block/census tract geographic identifiers, their use is 
not as common in medical (preferring ZICTA schema), agricultural, and social data sets, even those originating from 
Federal sources. While specialized tools and software (e.g. ArcGIS) exist specifically to mitigate data 
inconsistencies of this type, their cost is generally prohibitive and their use falls more within the domain of 
professionals, potentially limiting reach and audience. We will instead opt for the creation of crosswalks between 
the various geographic identifiers. This will likely lead to a reduction in the total levels of granularity available
 to end users, but will ensure a broader reach while still providing a viable framework for expansion in the future.

Communication Plan: Our plan for coordination is regular ad hoc Slack updates as we work asynchronously with 
dedicated Sunday zoom calls to go over anything that may be falling back, ensure we are on azimuth for completion, 
and discuss any other improvements we can make to represent the data as well as possible. Mike will implement and 
share a Git repository for data, code, documentation, and version control. We will hold 1 long initial planning
meeting to line out the steps and divide work evenly.
