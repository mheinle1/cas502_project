# Aspects of Poverty Analyzer

## Developers
This project was created as part of a team assignment for ASU Spring 2025 course CAS502: Computation. Methodology and code are developed by [Zachary Hofstra](https://github.com/zachofstra) and [Michael Heinle](https://github.com/mheinle1). Please report bugs to the project [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mheinle1/cas502_project). Similarly, any additional feature requests may be submitted to the repositoty as well.

## Project Overview
This core concept of this project is to develop a way to examine levels and aspects of poverty as experienced by various communities across the United States. While two communities may experience similar levels of poverty, the attributes, or what poverty looks like in each community, may be very different. This project offers a framework for comparing and contrasting the various 'faces' of poverty by focussing on a select catalog of environmental, social, and economic factors that we hope will allow users to go beyond the standard and often used dichotomies of urban vs rural, white vs non-white communities, coastal vs interior geographies, etc. 

## Data Overview
Project code has been developed using easily accessible, historically stable, consistent, and regularly updated dated sources with the hope that this will lend stability and longevity to the project and provide a highly customizable user experience. Additionally, all data sources have geographic components to allow mapping of the data at multiple levels of granularity (i.e. state, county, census tract) and code can be easily modified to fit user needs in this regard. 

### Data Sources and Acquisition
The data sources used for the project come from two primary sources; the [U.S.D.A. Web Soil Survey](https://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/app/), and the [U.S. Census/American Community Survey](https://data.census.gov/). The first provides environmental health and environmental resource availability. The latter covers a broad spectrum of social, demographic, and economic aspects. **Data sets required to run project code can be acquired using the links below.**
